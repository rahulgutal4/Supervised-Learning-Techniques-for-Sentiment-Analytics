# Supervised-Learning-Techniques-for-Sentiment-Analytics
In this project, supervised learning techniques were implemented for Sentiment Analysis. Classification techniques used were logistic regression as well as naive bayes classifier. The task of generating feature vector is performed using two methods: 1. A traditional   NLP   technique   where   the   features   are   simply   “important”   words   and   the   feature   vectors   are   simple   binary   vectors 2. the   Doc2Vec   technique   where   document   vectors   are   learned   via   artificial   neural   networks
